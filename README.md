# Interview Questions

You're a developer on the job hunt. What sorts of interview questions can you expect? What sorts of questions should you ask? Below are some questions I've encountered in actual interviews for dev positions, and some suggestions for questions to ask your interviewer(s).

## Start with [ichbindev's excellent "Questions for Me" repo](https://github.com/ichbindev/QuestionsForMe)

Then....

## Questions *from* the interviewer(s)

### **Note**: It's not a bad idea to frame your responses using the [STAR method](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629): Situation, Task, Action, Result

Can you describe a time when attention to detail was important, and what was the result?

Can you tell us about a time when you were given feedback that was genuinely impactful? What was the feedback, and what was the result?


## Questions *for* the interviewer(s)

### Company/Organization

What is the company culture like?

What is the response to mistakes?

What is the onboarding process like?

### Technical/Position

What type of problems will I be solving to begin with?

What would a typical day for someone in [position] look like?

What does the team structure look like? Who would I report to if I were in this position?

## What did I miss?

Have questions about what I'm doing? Have questions to add? Please open an issue, specifying whether it's a question *for me*, a question *from* and interviewer, or a question *for* an interviewer!
