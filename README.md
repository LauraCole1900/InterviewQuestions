## Questions *from* the interviewer(s)

Can you describe a time when attention to detail was important, and what was the result?

Can you tell us about a time when you were given feedback that was genuinely impactful? What was the feedback, and what was the result?


## Questions *for* the interviewer(s)

**Note**: It's not a bad idea to frame your responses using the [STAR method](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-the-star-interview-response-technique-2061629): Situation, Task, Action, Result

### Company/Organization

What is the company culture like?

What is the response to mistakes?

### Technical/Position

## What did I miss?
